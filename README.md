This is a small Java console-based quiz project created for practice of:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
2. Classes & Objects
3. Constructors
4. Getter & Setter methods
5. Arrays
6. Switch case

The program lets the user choose a quiz category (like Space or Hip-hop) and then displays multiple-choice questions, checks the answers, and shows the final score.
